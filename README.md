# DropBot: A Scripted Starcraft II Bot

Uses the [python-sc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2) framework.

DropBot's strategy is to use multi-pronged attacks as much as possible with marine drops, trying to outposition the enemy's main army.

At home, it turtles with walls, tanks, and static defense.
